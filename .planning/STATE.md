# Project State: Dicticus

**Last Updated:** 2026-04-23
**Milestone:** v2.1 Keyboard Extension & Polish (IN PROGRESS)

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-21)

**Core value:** Press a key, speak, release — accurate text appears at your cursor instantly, fully private, no cloud dependency.
**Current focus:** v2.1 — Keyboard Extension (text at cursor without app switching)

## Current Position

Phase: 17.5 of TBD (Inline Shortcut Dictation)
Plan: 1 of 2
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-04-23 — Plan 01 complete: isShortcutLaunch flag wired through intent-viewmodel pipeline.

Progress: [▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓] 100% (v2.0 phases)
Progress (v2.1): [▓▓▓▓░░░░░░] 40%

## Completed Milestones

- **v1.0 MVP** — Phases 1-5 — SHIPPED 2026-04-18
- **v1.1 Cleanup Intelligence & Distribution** — Phases 6-11 — SHIPPED 2026-04-21 (v1.1.1)
- **v2.0 iOS App — Shortcut Dictation** — Phases 12-16 — SHIPPED 2026-04-22
- **v2.1 Keyboard Extension & Polish** — Phase 17 — COMPLETED 2026-04-23

## Key Decisions

### Technical
- **D-15:** Used `NavigationSplitView` with adaptive logic for iPad sidebar support (Phase 16).
- **D-16:** Integrated `GRDB` for shared transcription history between app and future extensions (Phase 15).
- **D-17:** Implemented "Whats New" flow to highlight v2.0 features to upgrading users (Phase 16).
- **D-18:** Consistently clear `kbSource` and set `kbResultReady` in `DictationViewModel` regardless of success/failure to ensure reliable state and stop keyboard polling (Phase 17).
- **D-19:** Used `Timer`-based polling in `KeyboardViewController` (0.5s interval) as planned for simplicity and reliability (Phase 17).
- **D-20:** Switched `StopDictationIntent` to `LiveActivityIntent` for better interactive support in Dynamic Island (Phase 17).
- **D-21:** isShortcutLaunch flag read synchronously before async Task in checkPendingIntent to prevent race conditions (Phase 17.5).
- **D-22:** Flag reset in stopDictation ensures manual dictation after shortcut does not inherit shortcut mode (Phase 17.5).

## Active Concerns / Risks
- Phase 17: Keyboard extension dictation bounce blocked by iOS 26 restrictions — Apple broke all programmatic URL-opening from keyboard extensions. Keyboard typing works; dictation pivot to Phase 17.5.
- Phase 18: iCloud Sync conflict resolution for Dictionary entries.
- iOS 26 `SpeechAnalyzer` supports German — benchmark vs Parakeet v3 before committing to model download flow long-term.

## Roadmap Evolution
- Phase 17.5 inserted after Phase 17: Inline Shortcut Dictation — Auto-Return Flow (URGENT). Replaces keyboard extension bounce approach blocked by iOS 26.
